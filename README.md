About:  A full-stack application using React, and Firebase by Brad Traversy my one of my favorite teachers out there! After making a simple verison of this using VanillaJS NodeJS and PostgreSQL last year I thought it was time to give it a shot with react and a cloud based database. Here users can browse homes for sale or rent and create accounts from where they can post their own properties for sale along with images, also uses Google Authentication.

Purpose:  I have always had an interest in Real Estate and apps like Zillow and Offer-Up so I figured this would be a good project to do!.

Likes:  So far I'm enjoying making fullstack applications. Although I am a novince with backend related work, there's just something about getting everything to come together and work that gives such a sense of fulfillment. But for this project in particular I would say that it was interesting learning a database that does not use SQL which from what I'm seeing is easier to use because I didn't need to use Express or NodeJS to make any APIs so it was very streamlined. Also learning how to render Route paths dynamically using React, I just thought it was so cool, and honestly React itself - the more I learn the more I love it. A couple other things I really liked were learning to use leaflet and google geolocation.

Difficulties:  The things that gave me the toughest time here was the fact that Firebase doesn't do too well with error handling so it made it difficult when I got stuck a couple times when I was trying to retrieve data but I learned about how users have to be authenticated first.

Time:  I took a fair amount of time (over 80hrs) with this tutorial since I really wanted to learn Firebase. And now I have started using the things I learned from it in other projects
